Manuscript can be found in https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Partition_Coefficients_of_Methylated_DNA_Bases_Obtained_from_Free_Energy_Calculations_with_Molecular_Electron_Density_Derived_Atomic_Charges_/5793996

For each methylated DNA base (or amino acid analogue) atomic charges are contained in the gromacs topology files with their names according to the charge derivation method:
1. Hirshfeld-I (vaccum): HI.top
2. Hirshfeld-I implicit: S-HI.top
3. Hirshfeld-I dynamic obtained as average with QM/MM calculations: D-HI.top
4. MBIS implicit: S-MBIS.top
5. Amber99 force field: Amber.top
6. Gaff force field: Gaff.top

Input files for the free energy calculations and the mdp files are found in the folder: Input_Files
